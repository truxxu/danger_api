In order to run this on a local server, follow the next steps:

1. Install gems from the project

`bundle install`

2. Create database

`rails db:create`

3. Migrate database

`rails db:migrate`

4. Populate database

`rails db:seed`

5. Finally, run the local server. Assuming the front-end runs on port 3000, we will use a different one for this application

`rails start -p 4000 `
